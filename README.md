**DESCRIPTION OF TASKS PERFORMED** 
      



This project is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to work offline and support push notifications. The app includes a service worker (sw.js) that caches essential files to enable offline access and intercepts network requests to serve cached responses when the internet is unavailable. A web app manifest (manifest.json) ensures the app can be installed on a userâ€™s device like a native application. The push notification feature leverages the Push API and Notification API, allowing users to receive real-time updates even when the app is closed. A modern, styled button enables users to opt in for notifications, dynamically changing its appearance upon activation. The JavaScript logic (script.js) ensures smooth service worker registration and handles notification permissions efficiently. The app is responsive, making it accessible across different devices and browsers. The project is structured with a clean UI, optimized caching mechanisms, and an enhanced user experience, making it a solid foundation for future PWA development. 


This Progressive Web Application (PWA) is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a seamless, offline-first experience with push notifications for user engagement. The application incorporates a service worker (sw.js) that caches essential assets, ensuring the app remains accessible even without an internet connection. The web app manifest (manifest.json) allows users to install the app on their devices like a native application. One of the key features is push notifications, implemented using the Push API and Notification API, enabling real-time updates even when the app is not active. The interface includes a modern, well-styled notification button, which dynamically updates upon user interaction to reflect the notification status. The JavaScript logic (script.js) efficiently registers the service worker, requests user permission for notifications, and handles click events for a smooth experience. The app is designed with responsive UI elements, ensuring accessibility across devices. Additionally, it utilizes caching strategies via the Cache API to optimize performance and reduce network dependency. This project serves as a robust foundation for building scalable, fast, and interactive PWAs, combining offline functionality with real-time features. Future enhancements could include background sync, advanced caching techniques, and push notification integration with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to further improve user engagement.
